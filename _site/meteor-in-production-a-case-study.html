<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I teach mathematics at an international school. Last year, our administrators were looking for online curriculum management software for the organization.  I didn’t like any of the existing solutions, and had just discovered Meteor.</p>

<p>It just happened that I had a nine-day holiday coming up. So I wrote an extremely ambitious list of features for such a system and started hacking. To my amazement, I was able to tick off almost all the items in just over a week, leaving me with a pretty impressive prototype on my hands.</p>

<h2 id="the-fun-part">The Fun Part</h2>

<p>Back at school, I pitched the prototype to the administration and they went for it. So I spent two months over the summer writing a role based access control system, an undo-redo stack for all user transactions, and a bunch of widgets that gave me, among other things, one-line-in-a-template editable text, editable lists, routed tabs, and reactive dialogs.</p>

<p>With everything refactored, secure and more feature-complete, we launched “<a href="http://www.standbench.com/">Standbench</a>” in mid-August. Plaudits were rolling in and everyone was very pleased. Until disaster struck…</p>

<h2 id="trouble-in-paradise">Trouble in Paradise</h2>

<p>During a practical teacher training session that created a lot of simultaneous database writes, the server started crashing … hard. We were hosting <a href="http://www.standbench.com/">Standbench</a> at school, and the server couldn’t cope with the massive CPU hit that <a href="http://www.standbench.com/">Standbench</a> was dishing out (having to diff multiple subscriptions across numerous collections, all unique to each user).</p>

<p>So we had a problem.</p>

<h2 id="searching-for-help">Searching for Help</h2>

<p>In an <a href="http://book.discovermeteor.com/interview/nick-martin/">extremely informative interview</a> published in <a href="http://book.discovermeteor.com/">Discover Meteor</a> (Premium Edition only), Nick Martin (Meteor core dev), says “I wrote a benchmark app that very heavily used data, and I got about <strong>three</strong> concurrent users,” but he also says that apps without much data can serve <strong>thousands</strong> of concurrent users.</p>

<p>In the case of <a href="http://www.standbench.com/">Standbench</a>, we were crashing at about <strong>ten</strong> concurrent users, which obviously isn’t acceptable for a production scenario where we could very well have 200+.</p>

<h2 id="running-out-of-options">Running out of Options</h2>

<p>The solution to the issue of CPU use is not easy. After scaling vertically as far as possible, you’re still stuck with the fact that a node process runs in a single thread on a single core. And one CPU core can only do so much on its own.</p>

<p>So … I optimized the codebase as much as I knew how, using some principles from <a href="http://projectricochet.com/blog/things-you-need-know-when-scaling-meteor-js">this post</a> and others gleaned from that <a href="http://book.discovermeteor.com/interview/nick-martin/">extremely informative interview</a>.  And … we were still crashing at <strong>ten</strong> concurrent users.</p>

<h2 id="meteorhacks-to-the-rescue">MeteorHacks to the Rescue</h2>

<p>Enter <a href="http://meteorhacks.com/">Arunoda Susiripala and MeteorHacks</a>. Arunoda had just published his <a href="http://meteorhacks.com/introducing-smart-collections.html">Smart Collections</a> package so, with nothing to lose, I simply switched (almost) all instances of <code class="highlighter-rouge">new Meteor.Collection</code> in my app to <code class="highlighter-rouge">new Meteor.SmartCollection</code>. It took about 2 minutes and everything just worked.</p>

<p>Since then, <strong>we haven’t had a single server crash</strong>, although an informal load test with 20 concurrent users performing data intensive read actions still pushed the CPU to 100% (without the server failing).</p>

<h2 id="further-scaling-efforts">Further Scaling Efforts</h2>

<p>I was <strong>not</strong> using the <a href="http://meteorhacks.com/lets-scale-meteor.html">Smart Collections MongoDB Oplog integration</a>, so that was the next thing I did, which I understand is a huge factor in making the server load lighter. For good measure, I also scaled horizontally, using <a href="http://meteorhacks.com/load-balancing-your-meteor-app.html">HAProxy to load balance</a> across 4 instances of the node process (we have 4 cores available on the server), which presumably gives us close to 4 times the number of concurrent users.</p>

<p>At this stage, it feels like a lot of work to get a complex app deployed to scale on one’s own servers, even when serving a relatively small user base. <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/#deploying">Deploying to the meteor.com infrastructure</a> is sooo much easier, so I’m really looking forward to Galaxy (the Meteor Development Group’s upcoming PaaS for Meteor apps).</p>

<h2 id="the-present">The Present</h2>

<p>Six months into production, we’re still alive. But I maintain, in all sincerity, that if Arunoda had not published his <a href="http://meteorhacks.com/introducing-smart-collections.html">Smart Collections</a> when he did, <a href="http://www.standbench.com/">Standbench</a> would have been on the shelf by now – beautiful but useless.</p>

<p>I recently tried the oplog tailing that has now been integrated into the Meteor core, but it still lacks the comprehensive support that <a href="http://meteorhacks.com/introducing-smart-collections.html">Smart Collections</a> has for mongo operators so, not surprisingly, I noticed a marked increase in CPU usage. I’ve switched back to <a href="http://meteorhacks.com/introducing-smart-collections.html">Smart Collections</a> for the time being.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>

<p>There are two issues with <a href="http://meteorhacks.com/introducing-smart-collections.html">Smart Collections</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Very occasionally the client gets in a bad state where successful updates to the server DB are not made to the client’s minimongo collection (which is fixed by a browser refresh, but is confusing for the user).</li>
  <li><a href="http://meteorhacks.com/retiring-smart-collections.html">Arunoda has stopped developing Smart Collections</a>, so we’re currently in limbo waiting for the <a href="https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Oplog-Observe-Driver">Meteor core oplog integration</a> to catch up with Smart Collections in terms of real-world performance.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because of these issues, I will eventually switch back to the Meteor core Collections.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts-about-meteor-in-production-apps">Thoughts about Meteor in Production Apps</h2>

<p>Despite the challenges with scaling, at present, I don’t think I’ll be building a web app again <strong>without</strong> using Meteor. The development process was just too sweet. What would otherwise take months-to-years to develop can be put together in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>In my mind, the cost of having to provision/configure a lot of server resources is worth paying if it makes the development/maintenance process easier. Obviously this trade-off isn’t going to work for every use case.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I teach mathematics at an international school. Last year, our administrators were looking for online curriculum management software for the organization.  I didn’t like any of the existing solutions, and had just discovered Meteor.</p>

<p>It just happened that I had a nine-day holiday coming up. So I wrote an extremely ambitious list of features for such a system and started hacking. To my amazement, I was able to tick off almost all the items in just over a week, leaving me with a pretty impressive prototype on my hands.</p>

<h2 id="the-fun-part">The Fun Part</h2>

<p>Back at school, I pitched the prototype to the administration and they went for it. So I spent two months over the summer writing a role based access control system, an undo-redo stack for all user transactions, and a bunch of widgets that gave me, among other things, one-line-in-a-template editable text, editable lists, routed tabs, and reactive dialogs.</p>

<p>With everything refactored, secure and more feature-complete, we launched “<a href="http://www.standbench.com/">Standbench</a>” in mid-August. Plaudits were rolling in and everyone was very pleased. Until disaster struck…</p>

<h2 id="trouble-in-paradise">Trouble in Paradise</h2>

<p>During a practical teacher training session that created a lot of simultaneous database writes, the server started crashing … hard. We were hosting <a href="http://www.standbench.com/">Standbench</a> at school, and the server couldn’t cope with the massive CPU hit that <a href="http://www.standbench.com/">Standbench</a> was dishing out (having to diff multiple subscriptions across numerous collections, all unique to each user).</p>

<p>So we had a problem.</p>

<h2 id="searching-for-help">Searching for Help</h2>

<p>In an <a href="http://book.discovermeteor.com/interview/nick-martin/">extremely informative interview</a> published in <a href="http://book.discovermeteor.com/">Discover Meteor</a> (Premium Edition only), Nick Martin (Meteor core dev), says “I wrote a benchmark app that very heavily used data, and I got about <strong>three</strong> concurrent users,” but he also says that apps without much data can serve <strong>thousands</strong> of concurrent users.</p>

<p>In the case of <a href="http://www.standbench.com/">Standbench</a>, we were crashing at about <strong>ten</strong> concurrent users, which obviously isn’t acceptable for a production scenario where we could very well have 200+.</p>

<h2 id="running-out-of-options">Running out of Options</h2>

<p>The solution to the issue of CPU use is not easy. After scaling vertically as far as possible, you’re still stuck with the fact that a node process runs in a single thread on a single core. And one CPU core can only do so much on its own.</p>

<p>So … I optimized the codebase as much as I knew how, using some principles from <a href="http://projectricochet.com/blog/things-you-need-know-when-scaling-meteor-js">this post</a> and others gleaned from that <a href="http://book.discovermeteor.com/interview/nick-martin/">extremely informative interview</a>.  And … we were still crashing at <strong>ten</strong> concurrent users.</p>

<h2 id="meteorhacks-to-the-rescue">MeteorHacks to the Rescue</h2>

<p>Enter <a href="http://meteorhacks.com/">Arunoda Susiripala and MeteorHacks</a>. Arunoda had just published his <a href="http://meteorhacks.com/introducing-smart-collections.html">Smart Collections</a> package so, with nothing to lose, I simply switched (almost) all instances of <code class="highlighter-rouge">new Meteor.Collection</code> in my app to <code class="highlighter-rouge">new Meteor.SmartCollection</code>. It took about 2 minutes and everything just worked.</p>

<p>Since then, <strong>we haven’t had a single server crash</strong>, although an informal load test with 20 concurrent users performing data intensive read actions still pushed the CPU to 100% (without the server failing).</p>

<h2 id="further-scaling-efforts">Further Scaling Efforts</h2>

<p>I was <strong>not</strong> using the <a href="http://meteorhacks.com/lets-scale-meteor.html">Smart Collections MongoDB Oplog integration</a>, so that was the next thing I did, which I understand is a huge factor in making the server load lighter. For good measure, I also scaled horizontally, using <a href="http://meteorhacks.com/load-balancing-your-meteor-app.html">HAProxy to load balance</a> across 4 instances of the node process (we have 4 cores available on the server), which presumably gives us close to 4 times the number of concurrent users.</p>

<p>At this stage, it feels like a lot of work to get a complex app deployed to scale on one’s own servers, even when serving a relatively small user base. <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/#deploying">Deploying to the meteor.com infrastructure</a> is sooo much easier, so I’m really looking forward to Galaxy (the Meteor Development Group’s upcoming PaaS for Meteor apps).</p>

<h2 id="the-present">The Present</h2>

<p>Six months into production, we’re still alive. But I maintain, in all sincerity, that if Arunoda had not published his <a href="http://meteorhacks.com/introducing-smart-collections.html">Smart Collections</a> when he did, <a href="http://www.standbench.com/">Standbench</a> would have been on the shelf by now – beautiful but useless.</p>

<p>I recently tried the oplog tailing that has now been integrated into the Meteor core, but it still lacks the comprehensive support that <a href="http://meteorhacks.com/introducing-smart-collections.html">Smart Collections</a> has for mongo operators so, not surprisingly, I noticed a marked increase in CPU usage. I’ve switched back to <a href="http://meteorhacks.com/introducing-smart-collections.html">Smart Collections</a> for the time being.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>

<p>There are two issues with <a href="http://meteorhacks.com/introducing-smart-collections.html">Smart Collections</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Very occasionally the client gets in a bad state where successful updates to the server DB are not made to the client’s minimongo collection (which is fixed by a browser refresh, but is confusing for the user).</li>
  <li><a href="http://meteorhacks.com/retiring-smart-collections.html">Arunoda has stopped developing Smart Collections</a>, so we’re currently in limbo waiting for the <a href="https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Oplog-Observe-Driver">Meteor core oplog integration</a> to catch up with Smart Collections in terms of real-world performance.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because of these issues, I will eventually switch back to the Meteor core Collections.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts-about-meteor-in-production-apps">Thoughts about Meteor in Production Apps</h2>

<p>Despite the challenges with scaling, at present, I don’t think I’ll be building a web app again <strong>without</strong> using Meteor. The development process was just too sweet. What would otherwise take months-to-years to develop can be put together in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>In my mind, the cost of having to provision/configure a lot of server resources is worth paying if it makes the development/maintenance process easier. Obviously this trade-off isn’t going to work for every use case.</p>
