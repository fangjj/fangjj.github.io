> This is not an official Meteor announcement, but a close look at the recent changes on the Meteor Roadmap on Trello.

If you follow the [Meteor Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/hjBDflxp/meteor-roadmap) on Trello, you might have seen some notable changes today. Some of the major features like [Testing](https://trello.com/c/BQ3gu0no/12-official-testing-framework), [Windows](https://trello.com/c/ZMvnfMfI/11-official-windows-support) and notably [Galaxy](https://trello.com/c/FMdB7GAu/78-galaxy-managed-meteor-deploy-to-your-own-servers) has been moved to _**Under Consideration for 1.1+**_.

Now, most of the Meteor Core team is assigned to [Atmosphere Integration](https://trello.com/c/d2Hd1Jo1/9-operate-an-official-package-server-and-fold-meteorite-into-meteor). That is the major feature Meteor has left to do in it's roadmap to Meteor 1.0. After that we can expect to see Meteor 1.0, specially _**without**_ Galaxy. I assume, it will be released around end of the April or may be sometimes around May.

Previously, In the [description](https://trello.com/c/FMdB7GAu/78-galaxy-managed-meteor-deploy-to-your-own-servers) of Galaxy, it was about an alpha version. But now, it has been changed to General Availability. So we can expect a stable version of Galaxy when it will be released.
