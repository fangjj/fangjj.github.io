2013 was a great year for me. I had a lot of fun with Meteor and MeteorHacks. I hope you also enjoyed the articles and hacks behind MeteorHacks. A lot of people helped me with editing the articles and fixing bugs -- **thank you very much**. 

Actually, I was not a Meteor fan earlier, but one of my clients [Tom Murphy](http://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasmurphy) forced me to learn about Meteor and I should send him a letter of thanks. [DiscoverMeteor](https://www.discovermeteor.com/) was released on the very same day as I started learning Meteor; without it I would have given up studying Meteor. I would also like to thank all of you who have been reading, commenting on and trying out my hacks. Without an audience like you, I'm nothing.

_**Finally, we all should thank Meteor for building such a great framework.**_

My first Meteor hack was [meteor-cluster](http://meteorhacks.com/meteor-cluster-introduction-and-how-it-works.html). It is a [Redis](http://redis.io/) based Meteor scaling solution: it was the only hope back then. Then I started MeteorHacks (the blog), giving a proper introduction to meteor-cluster and what it does behind the scenes. Since then I've been hacking Meteor like crazy.

## Smart Collections

I was not happy with how Meteor dealt with MongoDB. After a little study I saw there were some places where it could be improved. That was the birth of [Smart Collections](http://meteorhacks.com/introducing-smart-collections.html) and the [Oplog integration](http://meteorhacks.com/lets-scale-meteor.html) into Meteor. Now its core concept is in the Meteor core. Together, we showed that Oplog integration is ideal for Meteor (Meteor had earlier planned to build a MongoDB proxy layer to scale Meteor, but the Oplog approach is much simpler and proven).

## Itâ€™s Time Now

Meteor is working very hard to stabilize Meteor and make it ready for 1.0. That's really nice and they are really good at it. I also hope they are cooking Galaxy and preparing it to blow our minds :)

Also, I have the blueprints for many new ways to improve Meteor in my mind. These may be on Meteor's roadmap or be completely crazy. I want to jump in and start working on them.  

Today, January 1 2014, MeteorHacks will be rebranded as the **Unofficial Meteor Research Lab.** I'll be working on core Meteor improvements with help from the community and [Pahan](https://twitter.com/pahans). We've already started working on a few projects and I'll be announcing them in upcoming weeks.

## So, what do you think?

It is a very long journey, and I hope together we can improve Meteor and make it super awesome. I am always open to new options, and you have shown me many new paths. I really want to know how you feel about the new MeteorHacks.
