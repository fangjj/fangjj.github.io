## JavaScript Support in Google

Google's [announced](http://venturebeat.com/2014/05/23/it-took-googles-web-crawlers-15-years-to-come-to-terms-with-javascript/) new search engine crawler can render JavaScript and understand dynamic pages. This is good news for Meteor since SEO was a road block for Meter. But it is unsure whether it can use WebSockets or SockJS. If that's an issue, FastRender can be used as a cure. 

In the coming weeks, Google will release a tool which helps us to understand how our webapp will be seen by the crawler.

## Upcoming Meteor Manual

For most of the people, Meteor is still a magic. That's why Meteor is working on a Manual. Now you can read a sample chapter of it on HackPad. 

* Read It: [Understanding Deps](https://meteor.hackpad.com/Understanding-Deps-aAXG6T9lkf6)

This won't be a replacement for DiscoverMeteor and EventedMind, but an extension to the Meteor Documentation.
