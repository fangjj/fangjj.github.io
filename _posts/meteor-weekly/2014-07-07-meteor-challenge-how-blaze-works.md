## Meteor Challenge

Meteor raised more than $20,000 for kids to learn programming with [Meteor Challenge 2014](https://challenge.meteor.com). Goal was to make $25,000 in a week, but we came to the close and that's a huge win.

## How Blaze Works

Blaze is the Meteor's reactive UI engine. It's one of the well designed technology in Meteor. To the user it's very similar to handlebars, but under the hood it's a collection of very complex components.
