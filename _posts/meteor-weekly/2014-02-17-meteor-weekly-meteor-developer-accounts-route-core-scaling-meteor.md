## Meteor Developer Accounts

Meteor is considering a new way to authenticate when you are deploying into meteor.com. If you are using `devel` branch, you can experience this now.

## Route Core - Routing and Server Side Rendering with React

This is something we didn't expect. React is a new project by Facebook which provides us a virtual DOM that can be programmed. Now we have a [project](https://atmosphere.meteor.com/package/routecore) which does routing and server side rendering if you are brave enough to use React with Meteor. We're not sure yet, but if this project can use Meteor templates instead React based syntax, this will be massive.

## Scaling Meteor

Scaling Meteor is always a problem for most of us. Last week, we saw two articles published in Discover Meteor Blog and MeteorHacks, which talks about this subject.

* [Meteor in Production - A Case Study](http://meteorhacks.com/meteor-in-production-a-case-study.html)
