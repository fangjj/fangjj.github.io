## Instant Login For Fast Render
Arunoda released a newer version of [fast-render](http://meteorhacks.com/fast-render/) with a feature called [instant login](http://meteorhacks.com/instant-login-for-meteor-with-fast-render.html). With that, fast-render could be able to load the private content of your site for the loggedIn users without connecting to the DDP server.
