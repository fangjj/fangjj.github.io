## DiscoverMeteor Day

Last Saturday, along with the session at [Meteor HQ](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/discover-meteor-day-registration-9683957979), Sacha and Tom open up anyone in the world to read [DiscoverMeteor](http://www.discovermeteor.com/) online for [free](https://www.discovermeteor.com/2013/12/09/discover-meteor-day/).

## Meteor 0.6.7 Release Candidate

Meteor 0.6.7 Release Candidate is [now available](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-talk/x7bS4CdxHv8) to try out with your app. It comes with a huge list of changes, but it doesn't have any public API changes. So it won't break you app. Try out and report bugs.

## MongoDB Oplog Production Usage

[Will Koffel](http://www.clearlytech.com/about/) shared his experience with MongoDB Oplog in [production](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-core/40QZ5T6k408) and showed us some pointers for a better Oplog integration.

## TernJS and Meteor

Initial [discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-talk/b_yGWIqXl7Y) on integrating [TernJS](http://ternjs.net/) has started. With TernJS, we can add MeteorJS code-intel support for text editors like vim, emacs and sublime.
