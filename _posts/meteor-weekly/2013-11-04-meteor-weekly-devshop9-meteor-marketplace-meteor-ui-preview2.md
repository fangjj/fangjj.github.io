## Meteor Devshop 9

We had Meteor [Devshop 9](http://www.meetup.com/Meteor-SFBay/events/141233822/) last week. It was packed with very good topics. Here are the topics discussed.

* [Building Production Quality Meteor App - Ritik Malhothra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMSth8t8gK0&feature=share&t=11m37s)
* [Fibers and Eventloop - Chris @ EventedMind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMSth8t8gK0&feature=share&t=41m)
* [Meteor UI Update - David G](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMSth8t8gK0&feature=share&t=1h10m38s)

## Meteor Marketplace

There was an idea to build a [Marketplace for Meteor Components](http://meteorhacks.com/the-meteor-marketplace.html). It got mixed responses. See the following links for the responses.

## DDP authentication via SRP (NodeJS)

Meteor can be accessed from NodeJS with [DDP NPM Module](https://npmjs.org/package/ddp). But it lacked SRP based Meteor authentication. There is a very [nice attempt](https://github.com/emgee3/srp-test) which shows you how to authenticate properly with Meteor using NodeJS DDP module.

## Templates for Meteor Apps

There are different ways to structure your Meteor app. [This discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-talk/OAgAI4mudgw) talks about a few pre-built templates you can use.

## Telescope v0.7 "Iron Scope"

Popular Telescope Meteor App [released a new version](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-talk/IX21n739EMU) with support for Iron Router. It is named **Iron Scope**.
