## Fast Render
[FastRender](http://meteorhacks.com/introducing-fast-render.html) improves the initial load time of your meteor app and gives 2-10 times faster page loads. It gives the same user experience as Server Side Rendering. 

[_**See How Fast It Is**_](http://meteorhacks.com/fast-render/#demo)

Adding fast render [support](http://meteorhacks.com/fast-render/usage/) to your existing meteor app is very simple and it comes with deep integration into [Iron Router](http://meteorhacks.com/fast-render/iron-router-support/) as well.

## Meteor Podcast

[Meteor Podcast](http://www.meteorpodcast.com/) covers mostly news and updates happening around the Meteor Community -- specially in [crater.io](http://crater.io). It is weekly podcast backed by [Differential](http://differential.io/).
