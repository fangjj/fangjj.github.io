## Meteor UI - Preview Release
Meteor UI is the upcoming rendering engine for Meteor which is supposed to be released with [Meteor 1.0](http://www.meteor.com/blog/2013/10/01/geoff-schmidt-at-devshop-8-getting-meteor-to-10) early next year. Now you can try out the preview version of Meteor UI. It is not production ready yet, but you can get your hands dirty with it.

## NodeJS Security Fix
NodeJS released a [major security fix](http://blog.nodejs.org/2013/10/18/node-v0-10-21-stable/) last week. It was a fix to prevent DOS attacks when you are serving HTTP with NodeJS. So this affects most of the NodeJS apps including Meteor. Meteor's plan to release a new version (0.6.6.2) with the fix by this week.

## Meteor and Packaged Apps
Meteor is not limited to the web. You can build mobile apps and browser extensions with meteor. There is a very impressive [discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-talk/vv6Rq8iGM0M) on how to work with packaged apps with Meteor. You can find a tool called **packmeteor** in the discussion, which allows you to automatically bundle your Meteor app for chrome (as a chrome packaged app) and for cordova/phonegap.

## Settings.json Usage
[Settings.json](http://docs.meteor.com/#meteor_settings) is Meteorâ€™s way of exposing settings and configurations to the app. This is still an experiment API and we can see a better configuration handling API near future, probably with 1.0

There is a very nice discussion on how people are using **settings.json** with their apps. See how you can use settings.json with your app.

## Iron Router Progress Bar
There is a very nice progress bar implementation for [Iron Router](https://github.com/EventedMind/iron-router) which mimics nprogress. Of course you can directly use [nprogress](http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/) with meteor, but this is a deeply integrated version into iron router
