## Getting Ready for Meteor 1.0

Meteor seems like so busy for Meteor 1.0 release and recently they've allocate most of their team to the [Atmosphere Integration](http://meteorhacks.com/recent-changes-on-the-meteor-roadmap.html).

In the same time, you can see a live demo of the new packaging system (AKA: Atmosphere Integration) in the next [Meteor Devshop SF](http://www.meetup.com/Meteor-SFBay/events/162165492/). So it seems like we are so close to see Meteor 1.0 get released; may be in Devshop SF April.

## Bower Integration

[Bower](http://bower.io/) is the NPM for the web. It is a project backed by Twitter and used by a lot people to install and manage client side libraries and plugins. Now you can use bower directly with Meteor, thanks to the [bower](http://beta.atmospherejs.com/package/bower) smart package by [Maxime](https://github.com/mquandalle).
