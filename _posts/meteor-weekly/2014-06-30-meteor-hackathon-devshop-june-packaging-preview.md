## Meteor Packaging Preview

Finally, now we can [try out](https://meteor.hackpad.com/Getting-Started-With-Unipackage-IOckQBQgXaQ) Meteor's new packaging system. It's something similar to meteorite but baked into meteor itself and comes with a better dependancy management system. With this new packaging system, we can distribute our own Meteor releases as well. That's something amazing.

Refer [this](https://meteor.hackpad.com/Getting-Started-With-Unipackage-IOckQBQgXaQ) getting started guide and play with the new packaging system. Don't forget to share your [experience](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-core/OS54_kc8O5U) and [learn](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-core/OS54_kc8O5U) from others.

## Meteor Explained

For some developers, Meteor is a superb framework, which they use to build awesome apps like LookBack, Respondly and Streem. But for some, it's like magic. Especially how Meteor makes MongoDB reactive in real time.

But actually Meteor is a combination of carefully crafted technologies built into a single framework. It's extensible and very easy to use. You can read [this MeteorHacks article](http://meteorhacks.com/journey-into-meteors-reactivity.html) to learn more about Meteor Internals.
