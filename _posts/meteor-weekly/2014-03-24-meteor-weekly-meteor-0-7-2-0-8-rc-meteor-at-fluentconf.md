## Meteor 0.7.2

As anticipated, Meteor released 0.7.2 last week with better oplog support & login hooks. Co-Founder of Meteor, Matt mentioned 0.7.2 as "[completing our work on scaling realtime MongoDB queries](https://www.meteor.com/blog/2014/03/18/meteor-072-scaling-realtime-mongodb)".

## Meteor 0.8 RC

Surprisingly, Meteor also [announced](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-talk/2w0TJF6k3kw) a release candidate of Meteor 0.8. This release comes with [Blaze](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Using-Blaze) - the new Meteor UI engine - replacing the old one, Spark. Everyone is so excited about this release and a lot packages are being modified for this release.

## Meteor at FluentConf

Two weeks before, Meteor's Matt and Emily spoke at the FluentConf 2014 and we were waiting for the videos. Now we have a [video of an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tObIpzqW4Aw) of both Matt & Emily where they talk about Meteor in general. 

Also, Meteor gets [mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEakCuiP2A&feature=youtu.be&t=8m22s) in another interview of Pete Hunt (React) & Spike Brehm (Rendr).
