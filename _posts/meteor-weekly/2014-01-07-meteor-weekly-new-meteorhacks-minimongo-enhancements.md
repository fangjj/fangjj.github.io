## The New MeteorHacks

Last Week, MeteorHacks has transformed into a [Meteor Research Lab](http://meteorhacks.com/meteorhacks-is-ready-for-2014-with-a-big-announcement.html). You could see some big announcements and releases throughout the year.

## MiniMongo Improvements

David Glasser has done some [improvements and refactoring](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-core/G-QyfHqVnS4) to MiniMongo last week. This will lead to more and more Oplog support in meteor. If you are also too concern about MiniMongo, better to try this pre-release.
