## MeteorHack 2014
Last weekend must be a busy one at Meteor HQ because of the [Meteor Summer Hackathon 2014](http://hackathon.meteor.com/). Although we don't have any official blog post yet, [twitter speaks](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=meteorhack&src=typd) pretty well.

## Open Sourcing Ralph Chat

Ralph is an awesome [chat app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ralph-chat/id782873767?mt=8) for your iOS devices built with Meteor. It's been around the news for couple of months. But now Ralph is [OpenSourced](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-talk/4xY54ZK4uCE) and you can see how it has been built.

## Sharable Kadira Traces
With [Kadira traces](https://kadira.io/blog/now-traces-can-be-shared-publicly/) you can see what exactly happened inside your Meteor methods and publication. They are pretty handy when debugging performance issues. Now, you can [share them](https://kadira.io/blog/now-traces-can-be-shared-publicly/) with others and ask help based on traces.
