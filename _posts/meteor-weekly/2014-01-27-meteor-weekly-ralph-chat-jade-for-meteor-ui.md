## Ralph Chat - Meteor on Mobile
Ralph is well executed example of how Meteor can be used to build Mobile Apps. It's 100% meteor and very hard to differentiate from a native app.

## Jade for Meteor UI
[Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) is a template language specially build for NodeJS. Many coffeescript fans used to use Jade. Now it is [possible to use](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-talk/ZrIZSXZZAJ0) Jade with upcoming Meteor UI, thanks to [Maxime Quandalle](https://github.com/mquandalle).
