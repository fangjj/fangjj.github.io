## Meteor Cordova Support

 In the last Devshop SF, Meteor announced and showcased how to build cordova apps with Meteor. It was super cool and you never need to worry about installing cordova and configuring it. 

Just run `meteor add-platform ios` and run your app inside an ios simulator with `meteor run ios`.

This is currently in alpha, but this is something you should try out. Watch following links for more information.
