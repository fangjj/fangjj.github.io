## Meteor 0.8.3 RC

Now we've a Meteor 0.8.3 RC to try it out. This release comes with a huge internal [blaze refactoring](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-core/DucHmVXjayg) to make blaze simpler and easy to use. [Try it](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-talk/JldNPrkJphg) with your app and share your  [experience](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-talk/JldNPrkJphg).

## Experimental Redis Support

MongoDB is the only officially supported database for Meteor until this month. Now, Meteor has [Redis Support](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-talk/Jl5Jt739wdA) too. This is currently labeled as an experiment, but it works.

## Velocity

Velocity is the official testing framework for Meteor 1.0. Most importantly, this is a  [community](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/velocity-core) powered project. Currently, velocity is under heavy development. But now you've documentation and resources to try velocity with your app.
