## Meteor 0.9.4

As we've anticipated now we've Meteor 0.9.4 and it [comes](https://www.meteor.com/blog/2014/10/13/meteor-094-mobile-and-testing) with a lot of performance and usability improvements to Meteor. You can learn more about them [here](https://www.meteor.com/blog/2014/10/13/meteor-094-mobile-and-testing).

Most importantly, this is the final 0.x version and next release is 1.0 - Yeah! (I hope there won't be any more new additions to 1.0 from here)

## Meteor & FathomDB

Meteor recently acquired a database startup called FathomDB. It seems like Meteor is trying to powerup it's database support. We've no idea what will be the outcome of this acquisition, but I strongly believe this is something related to Galaxy and additional database support for Meteor.
