## Meteor 0.9.1

Meteor 0.9.1 comes with [organizations support](https://www.meteor.com/blog/2014/09/04/meteor-091-organizations-blaze-APIs) for Meteor developer accounts and it's a must to have feature specially for teams.

Besides that, there have been few notable core API changes. (don't worry, they are [backward compatible](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-core/lCdIJegchRc) at least until 1.0). See those [api changes](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/History.md#v091).

## Kadira Hub
