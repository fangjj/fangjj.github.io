## Meteor 0.8.2

Meteor 0.8.2 just got released today and it comes with one of the major change to the meteor core. Meteor uses [SRP](http://srp.stanford.edu/ndss.html) based login system from the very first day when it [released](https://www.meteor.com/blog/2012/10/17/meteor-050-authentication-user-accounts-new-screencast) accounts-passwords package.

But now, Meteor uses popular [bcrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) algorithm based solution instead of SRP. Upgrade is [seamless](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/release/0.8.2/History.md#meteor-accounts) for your production app. But once upgraded, you can't downgrade it.

0.8.2 also comes with a lot of bug [fixes and improvements](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/release/0.8.2/History.md#v082).
