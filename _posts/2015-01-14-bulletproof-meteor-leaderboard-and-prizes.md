I hope you've seen the BulletProof Meteor [leaderboard](https://bulletproofmeteor.com/leaderboard). You might even be listed on it as well. Let me tell you a little about the leaderboard.

* It's a weekly leaderboard.
* It is reset every Sunday at 12:00 midnight GMT.
* Points are calculated for the current week for each user.
* The top 20 users are listed on the leaderboard.

You get points for completing lessons. You can see the number of points each step is worth in the step navigation menu as shown below:

If any given step has a question, you need to complete it to get the points. If you skip the question, you won't get any points. But you can come back later and answer it.

We hope getting points and being listed on the leaderboard will be fun and give you some encouragement.

## Prizes

And we've decided to offer prizes to users based on their leaderboard position each week. Currently, we are giving discounts for Kadira's [paid plans](https://kadira.io/pricing.html). (We'll have more prizes in the future.)

Here are the prizes:

* 1st place - FREE access to Kadira's startup plan for 4 months
* 2nd place - FREE access to Kadiraâ€™s startup plan for 3 months
* 3-5th places - 50% discount off Kadira's startup plan for 4 months
* 6-10th places - 25% discount off Kadira's startup plan for 4 months

You need to take up the offer within one month after you've been placed on the leaderboard.

> This offer is also valid for the winners of past leaderboards. For those winners, one month is calculated from today (January 14, 2015).

## How to collect your prize

If you are a winner, just send your username and the leaderboard URL to hello [at] meteorhacks.com.
Then we'll give you instructions for how to collect your prize.

We hope this will energize you to learn more to get more from BulletProof Meteor.
