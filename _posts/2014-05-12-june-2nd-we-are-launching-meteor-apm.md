It's not a secret that we have been working on Meteor APM over the last six months. [Meteor APM](https://meteorapm.com/) is an application performance monitoring service specifically built for Meteor.

It can tell you exactly what is happening inside your Meteor app and show you the most important metrics that can be used to optimize your app. In addition, you can drill down into the function call level and determine the exact reason for the performance issues and errors.

Don't just take my word. Take a look at these comments by our early users:

During the last six months, we have been working with more than 200 developers, and we are currently serving over 100 live apps with Meteor APM. We are thrilled with the comments we have received so far,  and our infrastructure is ready. Therefore, we've decided to release Meteor APM on June 2.

We'll be hosting a webinar along with the release. Join us on [June 2 at 9 a.m. PDT](http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?qm=1&lid=8,2643743,1248991,1796236&h=8&date=2014-6-2&sln=9-10). Register [Here for the Webinar](http://mad.ly/signups/109123/join).
