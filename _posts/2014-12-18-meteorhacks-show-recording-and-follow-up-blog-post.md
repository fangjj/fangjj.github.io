We had the [MeteorHacks Show 2](https://meteorhacks.com/meteorhacks-show-server-side-rendering-kadira-insight.html) on the 16th, and it was a very successful [event](http://www.crowdcast.io/e/meteorhacks-show) with more than **200** attendees. We had Meteor developers from around the world, and the chat on the [crowdcast](http://www.crowdcast.io/e/meteorhacks-show) was super busy.

Here’s the recording:

(There was an issue with the audio in some parts; we’ll improve that next time.)

Our main topic was server-side rendering, and I did a follow-up blog post based on the talk I did. You can read it here:
