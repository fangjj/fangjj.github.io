Docker is making the history with a lot of tooling and innovations around it. If you are new to Docker, it's a way to run application with isolation from each other. It's also a portable way to distribute apps and services. I've written an [article](https://meteorhacks.com/docker-container-war-and-meteor.html) on Docker and have a look at it.

So in the next episode of MeteorHacks Show, we will talk about Docker and how we can relate it with Meteor.

### Justin from MDG will join with us

Justin works on [Galaxy](https://trello.com/c/FMdB7GAu/78-galaxy-managed-meteor-deploy-to-your-own-servers) at [MDG](https://www.meteor.com/people) and he has done a lot of experiments and research with Docker. So, he's an ideal person for a discussion like this. He'll be joining with us and he'll share his views on Docker and how they use Docker at MDG.

We are going live on [6th May at 9 AM PDT](http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?qm=1&lid=8,30,2147714,524901&h=8&date=2015-4-6&sln=9-10).

[Click here](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/meteorhacks-show-may-2015) to register with the [Webinar](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/meteorhacks-show-may-2015) and I bet this will be something awesome.
