It's been almost an year, we did the [first episode](https://meteorhacks.com/whats-happended-at-the-first-meteorhacks-show.html) of the MeteorHacks Show. I don't know why we couldn't do it after that. Okay, let's do it again.

### Server Side Rendering

First, we're going to talk about Server Side Rendering. It's related to our recently released [meteorhacks:ssr](https://github.com/meteorhacks/meteor-ssr) package and how you can use it in practical scenarios. Here are some of the things we are planned to discuss:

* Get rid of PhantomJS for the SEO stuff
* Emails with inline CSS
* PDF generation 

### Kadira Insight

Next, we are going to show you a Kadira feature we are about to release. It's **Kadira Insight**. With that, you can identify patterns in your app. Just like:

* How your CPU increases with the number of sessions?
* Does network impact affects CPU usage?
* When users are more active?

After that, of course you can ask questions. We are happy to answer and share our experience. 

So, [join with us](http://www.crowdcast.io/e/meteorhacks-show) on 16th December on 9 AM PST.
